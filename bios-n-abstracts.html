        <p><strong><em>Title: Enterprise Challenges in Federated AI Solutions</em></strong></p>
		</h3>
        <p>Federated learning provides a significant opportunity in addressing many challenges of real-world challenges when using AI/ML based solutions. The key challenge in enterprises is associated with the difficulties in moving data around an enterprise. Most businesses have their data spread out in multiple locations, data at each location can grow to be fairly substantial, and moving data across such locations may be restricted due to regulatory or security concerns, latency and delays in moving data, or the expense of the data transfer. Federated learning provides a clear advantage for enterprise use-cases since model training can be speeded up by avoid data migration, and each enterprise site has sufficient and comparable computing capacity to train models. Military coalitions have a very similar situation. They have data at the head-quarters or command centers of different countries that make up the coalition, but they may have limited ability to exchange the data in raw. The bulk of current academic research in federated learning, however, is not suitable for use within the enterprise use-case scenarios. A big stumbling block in the current federated learning academic research is that it relies on a synchronous training of the AI model at all sites. This synchronization may be feasible in some situations, but is usually cumbersome and very difficult to attain in practice. In order to be effective, federated learning must be done in an asynchronous manner. Another set of challenges arise due to the fact that the data schematics, the input features and the output labels used within the data space are usually different across different sites. Before the model training can even begin, one needs to synchronize the information about the data, attain a common vocabulary and transform data so that all parties are using a single model with consistent sets of inputs and outputs. In this talk, we will discuss these and other challenges and how we have overcome them when creating real-world solutions. In order to address these challenges, one needs to perform a set of intensive transformations and modifications of the available data at each site before model fusion can begin. Systems which can be optimized for such transformations, data generation and data encoding are needed in order to make federated learning successful in the enterprise.&nbsp;</p>
